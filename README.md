# To-Do-List
A simple to do list app with backend storage with Firebase's Firestore

## Accessing Application

The app is embedded as a React Component on my website and can be accessed by visiting: navjotchahal.com/#/projects

## Overview

To do app is a very simple application that can replace our daily notepad. It is as simple as it says. A list to remember things to do. Built using React for the front end and Firestore for the database.

## Motivation

The "Full stack" nature of this project idea was very critical for me to give a deeper insight into modern technologies used for web development. This project also helped me to keep track of the bugs and issues for my later projects as well.

### Key Challenges and Learnings:
I encountered and overcame the following key challenges when developing this application.
1. I used traditional React classes to create components for this app and got to know the old version lifecycle methods like ComponentDidMount, ComponentWillUnmount, etc.
2. Used NoSQL-based database i.e. Firestore to store list to backend on each new addition/deletion of entry.
3. Applied my algorithms knowledge to create a QuickSort function to sort the list received from the backend by their date stamp.

## Future Contributions
This project was developed as a learning project but still will receive future updates to add authorization and user-specific lists.
